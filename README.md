# HealthWellness - Full Project

This package contains a minimal **Frontend (Vite + React)** and **Backend (Express)** implementation.

## Run locally

### Backend
```
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```
Backend will start at http://localhost:4000

### Frontend
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open the dev URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173) and the frontend is configured to use the backend endpoints at http://localhost:4000

## Notes
- Frontend uses `recharts` for charts.
- Backend stores contacts and returns prakriti analysis result.
